Embed Glean search and chat in my internal web app using the Glean Web
SDK, following the recipe at
https://developers.glean.com/cookbook/embed-search-chat

Steps:

1. Ask me for my Glean backend URL (https://{instance}-be.glean.com).
2. Install the SDK: npm install @gleanwork/web-sdk. (If the app has no
   build toolchain, fall back to the script tag from my Glean app domain:
   <script defer src="https://{GLEAN_APP_DOMAIN}/embedded-search-latest.min.js"></script>
   — the same methods appear on window.GleanWebSDK.)
3. Add a search box and results container, then:
   import { renderSearchBox, renderSearchResults } from "@gleanwork/web-sdk";
   renderSearchBox(searchBoxElement, { backend, onSearch: (query) =>
   renderSearchResults(resultsElement, { query }) });
4. Add a chat container (position: relative, display: block, explicit
   width/height), then:
   import { renderChat } from "@gleanwork/web-sdk";
   renderChat(containerElement, { backend });
5. Default SSO auth needs no extra configuration. If I ask for
   server-to-server auth instead, follow
   https://developers.glean.com/libraries/web-sdk/authentication/server-to-server
   and keep the API key strictly server-side.

Verify by running the app and issuing a search; results must respect my
Glean permissions.

## Setup

- Scaffold web SDK embed

## Reference

Embeds Glean search and chat into an existing web app via the Glean Web SDK npm package @gleanwork/web-sdk (renderSearchBox, renderSearchResults, renderChat named exports; script-tag fallback exposes the same methods on window.GleanWebSDK). Pass the backend option to route users directly to the instance. Auth is Glean SSO by default or server-to-server tokens minted by a backend holding an admin API key with SEARCH and CHAT scopes. All results are permission-aware per user.
