Build "Customer 360: an account page built from your own content" following https://developers.glean.com/cookbook/customer-360

1. **Pick a path**
   Path A (Platform Search + Chat) builds an open-ended explorable dashboard: parallel search.query tiles and POST /api/chat for journey summary and saved prompts. Path B (Platform Agents) keeps the same page UX but runs synthesis through glean.agents.createRun against a template Account Brief agent.

### Platform Search Chat

Path A — parallel Platform Search tiles + Platform Chat synthesis

1. **Scaffold the project**

   ```bash
   npx tiged --mode=git gleanwork/glean-cookbook/recipes/customer-360/platform-search-chat customer-360
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd customer-360 && npm install
   ```

3. **Set credentials**
   Fill in GLEAN_API_TOKEN, GLEAN_SERVER_URL, and GLEAN_ACCOUNT_NAME. The app runs as you; there is no act-as.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Run it**
   Leaves the server running so you can try it yourself at http://localhost:3000 — stop it (Ctrl-C) before the verify step below, which starts its own instance.

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Verify**
   Loads credentials from .env (same as npm start), runs the demo queries against the account you picked, and asserts cited answers with blank unsupported KPI fields. Do not report this recipe as done until this passes.
   ```bash
   npm run verify
   ```

### Platform Agents

Path B — Platform Agents createRun for prescriptive account briefs

1. **Scaffold the project**

   ```bash
   npx tiged --mode=git gleanwork/glean-cookbook/recipes/customer-360/platform-agents customer-360
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd customer-360 && npm install
   ```

3. **Set credentials**
   Fill in GLEAN_API_TOKEN, GLEAN_SERVER_URL, GLEAN_ACCOUNT_NAME, and GLEAN_AGENT_ID (Account Brief agent). The app runs as you; there is no act-as.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Run it**
   Leaves the server running so you can try it yourself at http://localhost:3000 — stop it (Ctrl-C) before the verify step below, which starts its own instance.

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Verify**
   Loads credentials from .env (same as npm start), runs the demo queries against your Account Brief agent, and asserts cited answers (or an explicit failure if the agent is missing or unauthorized). Do not report this recipe as done until this passes.
   ```bash
   npm run verify
   ```

## Reference

Platform-only recipe. Search: glean.search.query -> POST /api/search, results[].title/url/snippets (string[]). Chat: fetch POST /api/chat (until glean.chat.create ships); request {input, stream:false, store:true}; response output[].content[] type=output_text with annotations[].sources[]. Agents: glean.agents.createRun(request, agentId) -> POST /api/agents/{agent_id}/runs; stream:false returns PlatformAgentRunWaitResponse synchronously (no polling); messages use role USER|GLEAN_AI and content[{text,type:text}]. Experimental opt-in via X_GLEAN_INCLUDE_EXPERIMENTAL. Do NOT teach glean.client.chat.create, glean.client.search.query, or glean.client.agents.run. Auth is the caller's own token; impersonation/act-as was removed from the cookbook recipes. Tokens server-side only. The account and every figure on the page come from the reader's own instance. Nothing may hardcode an account name, owner, ARR, seat count or renewal date: an earlier version returned a fixed demo account on the live path, so the KPI header showed one fictional customer's numbers whatever retrieval returned. Use GLEAN_SERVER_URL rather than deriving the backend from an instance name, and GLEAN_ACCOUNT_NAME for the account. This recipe does not depend on examples/sample-catalog.

## Verify

- **Query:** "What's the status of our renewal with that account?"
  **Expected:** Returns a non-empty answer citing real documents about the account you built the page around. Substitute the name when you ask — there is no fixed query text for a page built around whichever account you pick.
- **Query:** "Give me a customer summary"
  **Expected:** Synthesizes across more than one source with a citation per claim, rather than restating a single document.
- **Query:** "What are the renewal risks?"
  **Expected:** Either names risks grounded in cited content, or says it has none to report. It must not infer risk the sources don't support, and the KPI header must leave unsupported fields blank rather than showing a figure no document contains.
