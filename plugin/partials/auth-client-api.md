Use the first available credential path:

1. **Glean OAuth:** ask for the user's work email and run:
   ```bash
   node <plugin-root>/scripts/resolve-backend.mjs <work-email>
   ```
   If `oauthAvailable` is true, register a public client through the returned backend's Dynamic
   Client Registration endpoint and use authorization code + PKCE. Reuse the client id and refresh
   token.
2. **External IdP OAuth:** if Glean OAuth is unavailable, ask whether the user's administrator has
   configured Okta, Azure AD, Google, or another IdP for Glean Client API access. Use that sign-in
   flow when available.
3. **Glean API token:** otherwise request a token carrying the scopes declared by the recipe.

Do not use client credentials for an end-user Client API integration. Keep access and refresh tokens
server-side.
