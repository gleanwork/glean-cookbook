Follow the selected authentication path. If OAuth is selected, run the recipe's shipped login
command with its declared scopes. If the documented token path is selected, skip OAuth login
and use that path's declared secure configuration. Keep sign-in and secret entry user-controlled.
Do not implement or alter OAuth while setting up the recipe, and do not silently substitute a
path when the documented one fails.
