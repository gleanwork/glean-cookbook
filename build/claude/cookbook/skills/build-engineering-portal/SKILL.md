Build the "Engineering portal with Glean" flagship recipe from
https://developers.glean.com/cookbook/build-engineering-portal

It composes two building blocks:

1. Index the portal's service catalog into Glean with the open-source
   indexing SDK (follow
   https://developers.glean.com/api-info/indexing/getting-started/overview).
2. Embed Glean search and chat into the portal UI with the Web SDK (see
   https://developers.glean.com/cookbook/embed-search-chat — same
   container sizing and initialMessage guidance applies here).

Style the portal shell itself per the house style below (real logomark,
teal accent) so the catalog UI and the embedded search/chat feel like one
cohesive app, not two mismatched pieces bolted together.

Ask me for: my Glean instance/backend domain, an Indexing API token, and
my Glean web app domain. See Verify below for what a correct build must do.

## Setup

- Scaffold connector
- Scaffold web SDK embed

## Reference

Flagship showcase composing the custom-connector and Web SDK embed recipes: a service-catalog portal whose catalog is indexed into Glean via the indexing SDK, with Glean search and chat embedded back into the portal UI. Requires a Glean-issued Indexing API token for the connector and SEARCH/CHAT scopes for the embed.

## Authentication

This recipe offers a path choice. Apply the block matching the path the user picks:

### `indexing-token`

Indexing API operations accept Glean-issued tokens only — OAuth does not apply here regardless of
tenant configuration (per developers.glean.com/api-info/client/authentication/oauth). Don't run an
OAuth detection chain for an indexing recipe; go straight to asking for a Glean
Indexing API token (`GLEAN_INDEXING_API_TOKEN`) and server URL (`GLEAN_SERVER_URL`), the same way
`index-custom-source` already does.

### `web-sdk-cookie`

No explicit credential handling — the Web SDK's default `authMethod: 'sso'` relies on the user's
existing browser session with Glean (they're already logged in, or get redirected to log in).
Don't ask for a token or walk through OAuth for this path; that's a different, unnecessary auth
model. If the recipe or user asks for server-to-server auth instead, that's a deliberate
opt-out of cookie auth into the `client-api-oauth-or-token` flow — don't blend the two.

### `client-api-oauth-or-token`

Glean supports three ways to get a Client API credential. Try them in this order — don't assume
one over the others, since which are available depends on how the tenant is configured:

1. **Glean OAS (Glean's own OAuth Authorization Server)** — the most flexible, self-service
   option, and the one to try first. It's disabled by default per-tenant, so detect it rather
   than assume:
   - Ask for the user's work email — not a raw backend URL. Resolve their tenant and check OAuth
     availability with `resolve-backend.mjs`, bundled alongside this plugin's skills (a sibling of
     the `skills/` directory, under `scripts/`) — locate it and run it, don't hand-derive the
     `config/search` call or the `.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` check from memory, since
     getting either wrong silently resolves to the wrong tenant or the wrong auth path. Its
     invocation is:
     ```bash
     node <path-to-this-plugin>/scripts/resolve-backend.mjs <their work email>
     ```
     Prints `{"instance", "backend", "oauthAvailable"}` — `backend` is the real Client API
     backend (verified live for a `glean.com` email, resolves to `scio-prod-be.glean.com`, and for
     at least one real customer domain), and `oauthAvailable` tells you whether to continue with
     Glean OAS below or fall back to option 2.
   - If `oauthAvailable` is `true` — use `authorization_code` + PKCE (verified live against
     `scio-prod-be.glean.com`: this is the grant Glean's own docs call "the recommended
     authentication method for Client API integrations," and what MCP hosts already use for
     their own sign-in flow). Do **not** use `client_credentials` even though it appears in
     `grant_types_supported` — a general client-credentials/service-account flow for the Client
     API is explicitly not yet a supported path for this kind of integration. If registration or
     the token exchange itself fails downstream, that also means Glean OAS isn't usable for this
     tenant; move to option 2.
   - Get a `client_id` via **Dynamic Client Registration** — the metadata's
     `registration_endpoint` (verified live: `POST {backend}/oauth/register` with `client_name`,
     `redirect_uris`, `grant_types: ["authorization_code", "refresh_token"]`,
     `response_types: ["code"]`, `token_endpoint_auth_method: "none"` returns `201` with a real
     `client_id`, no admin pre-approval needed). This is the same mechanism real MCP hosts
     already use to connect to Glean — self-service, not something that requires the end user or
     their IT admin to pre-register a Static OAuth Client first. Register once per app, reuse the
     `client_id` for every subsequent login from that app.
   - Complete the `authorization_code` + PKCE exchange with that `client_id` — a real browser
     login (the user signs in via their normal SSO), then exchange the returned code at
     `{backend}/oauth/token` for an access token + `refresh_token`. Use the refresh token to
     avoid repeating the interactive login on every run.
2. **IdP OAuth** — the customer's own identity provider (Okta, Azure AD, Google, etc.) issues the
   token instead of Glean's own authorization server. This is admin-configured on the customer's
   side, not something discoverable or self-service the way Glean OAS is — if Glean OAS isn't
   enabled, ask the user whether their Glean admin has set up OAuth with an external IdP, and if
   so get an access token via that IdP-integrated sign-in flow rather than guessing at one.
3. **Glean Token** — least preferred, most cumbersome: the user needs either an admin to grant
   them a token, or the API Token Creator role themselves. Fall back to this only after ruling out
   both OAuth options above, by asking for an API token with the scope the recipe needs.

## Language

Ask me which language to build in before starting: Python, TypeScript.

## House style

This recipe renders a Web SDK UI. Apply the cookbook's shared conventions below.

Primary accent: `#0E8C84` (teal). Use this for the primary button, header accent, or active
state — not Glean's own blue.

Use the real logomark, not a colored `<div>`/`<span>`. For light backgrounds:

```svg
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 64 64" width="64" height="64" role="img" aria-label="Acme Corp">
  <title>Acme Corp</title>
  <rect x="0" y="0" width="64" height="64" rx="18" fill="#0E8C84"></rect>
  <path fill-rule="evenodd" fill="#ffffff" d="M32 13 L55 52 L9 52 Z M32 29 L43 46 L21 46 Z"></path>
</svg>
```

For dark backgrounds/dark mode:

```svg
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 64 64" width="64" height="64" role="img" aria-label="Acme Corp">
  <title>Acme Corp</title>
  <rect x="0.75" y="0.75" width="62.5" height="62.5" rx="17.5" fill="#12B3A6" stroke="rgba(255,255,255,0.18)" stroke-width="1.5"></rect>
  <path fill-rule="evenodd" fill="#0A1615" d="M32 13 L55 52 L9 52 Z M32 29 L43 46 L21 46 Z"></path>
</svg>
```

Inline either `<svg>` directly, or save it as `logo.svg` and reference it — do not recreate the
mark from a text description. If you have filesystem/network access to the private
`gleanwork/glean-cookbook` repo, the canonical files are `brand/logomark-light.svg`,
`brand/logomark-dark.svg`, and `brand/tokens.json` (full color/type tokens); otherwise the SVGs
above are the complete, self-contained source.

`renderChat`/`renderSearchBox`/`renderSearchResults` need an explicit-sized container
(`position: relative`, `display: block`, a real `width`, a real `height`) or the widget won't
render at all. Beyond that minimum:

- **Height**: 480–500px reads as a properly-proportioned embedded panel. Taller containers
  (560px+) leave visible dead space below Glean's own chat landing view, which is a fixed-height
  hero, not something that stretches to fill its container.
- **First paint**: pass `initialMessage` (a `ChatOptions` field) with the recipe's own first demo
  query, e.g. `renderChat(el, { initialMessage: "What's our PTO policy?" })`. This opens straight
  into a real, cited answer instead of an empty "Ask Assistant anything" landing screen — a much
  better first impression, and it doubles as an on-load verification that the integration works.

## Verify

Do not report this recipe as done until you have run it for real (against a live Glean instance,
with real credentials) and confirmed every query below produces its expected behavior. A build
that runs without errors but fails one of these checks is not done — fix it and re-run before
reporting success.

- **Query:** "Who's on call for payments-service?"
  **Expected:** Answer names the current on-call owner from the indexed developer catalog, with a citation to that catalog entry.
- **Query:** "What's the deploy and rollback process for payments-service?"
  **Expected:** Answer describes the real deploy/rollback steps from the indexed runbook, with a citation — not a generic, made-up process.
- **Query:** "Summarize PAY-2114"
  **Expected:** Answer summarizes the real indexed PAY-2114 incident ticket content, with a citation to it — not a fabricated summary.
