# Cookbook conventions

Apply only the authentication method declared by the selected recipe.

## Web SDK SSO

No explicit credential handling — the Web SDK's default `authMethod: 'sso'` relies on the user's
existing browser session with Glean (they're already logged in, or get redirected to log in).
Don't ask for a token or walk through OAuth for this path; that's a different, unnecessary auth
model. If the recipe or user asks for server-to-server auth instead, that's a deliberate
opt-out of cookie auth into the `client-api-oauth-or-token` flow — don't blend the two.

## Client API OAuth or token

Use the first available credential path:

1. **Glean OAuth:** ask for the user's work email and run:
   ```bash
   node <plugin-root>/scripts/resolve-backend.mjs <work-email>
   ```
   If `oauthAvailable` is true, register a public client through the returned backend's Dynamic
   Client Registration endpoint and use authorization code + PKCE. Reuse the client id and refresh
   token.
2. **External IdP OAuth:** if Glean OAuth is unavailable, ask whether the user's administrator has
   configured Okta, Azure AD, Google, or another IdP for Glean Client API access. Use that sign-in
   flow when available.
3. **Glean API token:** otherwise request a token carrying the scopes declared by the recipe.

Do not use client credentials for an end-user Client API integration. Keep access and refresh tokens
server-side.

## Indexing token

Indexing API operations accept Glean-issued tokens only — OAuth does not apply here regardless of
tenant configuration (per developers.glean.com/api-info/client/authentication/oauth). Don't run an
OAuth detection chain for an indexing recipe; go straight to asking for a Glean
Indexing API token (`GLEAN_INDEXING_API_TOKEN`) and server URL (`GLEAN_SERVER_URL`), the same way
`index-custom-source` already does.

## Current API contracts

Before implementing a Glean API or SDK response shape, confirm the current contract with this
plugin's `glean-developer-docs` MCP server (`docs_search`, then `docs_fetch`). Follow current
deprecation notices. Recipe reference text defines intent and recipe-specific constraints; official
documentation defines endpoint and field details.

## UI

For scaffolded recipes, link `/glean-cookbook.css` and compose its existing primitives: `.layout`,
`.card`, `.frame`, `.pill`, `.note`, `.empty`, `.hit`, `.citations`, `.step`, `.chat-row`, `.msg`,
`.kpi`, and `.sdk-embed`. Use the supplied design tokens for recipe-specific CSS.

Use `public/glean-logomark.svg`; do not recreate the mark. For a build without scaffolded assets,
copy the tokens and mark from `https://github.com/gleanwork/glean-cookbook/tree/main/brand`.

Style only the surrounding page for Web SDK components. The embedded Glean UI supplies its own
branding. If the user wants their company's identity, replace the logo and accent consistently.

Give `renderChat`, `renderSearchBox`, and `renderSearchResults` a positioned container with explicit
width and height; 480–500px is a good default. Pass the recipe's first demo query as
`initialMessage` when the experience should open directly into a cited answer.
